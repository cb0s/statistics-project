This is the solution of _Cedric Bös_ for the project of _Estadística descriptiva y probabilidades_ at the _Universidad Finis Terrae_ in
Santiago de Chile.


## Structure

All the data analysis was done in Jupyter Notebooks. These can be found in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder.
The used data for this project is located in [data](data).


## Requirements

A Python 3.10 Environment has been used in the development process. The used dependencies can be installed with
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). It is recommended to use a separate
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) for this project.
